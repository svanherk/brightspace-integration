# brightspace-integration

[![Build status][ci-image]][ci-url]
[![Dependency Status][dependencies-image]][dependencies-url]

The goal of this project is to bring together many other external libraries and modules for inclusion into a particular build of Brightspace.

## Building

The first time you build, install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Rebuild assets to the `build` directory:

```shell
npm run build
```

### Troubleshooting on Windows

Building BSI in Windows doesn't always go smoothly. Here are some of the issues that have been encountered, and their potential solutions:

Trouble | Shooting
------------ | -------------
**build:icons fails:** ```cannot copy from `...'images\**\*.*'` to `...'images\**\*.*'`: cannot read from `...'images\**\*.*'`: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '...'images\**\*.*''``` | remove single quotes from `package.json`.`scripts`.`build:icons`
**npm i fails:** ```error: [cli.main]   Promise rejection: Error: Failed to execute "git ls-remote --tags --heads https://github.com/Polymer/polymer.git", exit code of #128 fatal: Unable to find remote helper for 'https'``` | Run `git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://` in command prompt

## Running Locally

To test against a local Brightspace environment, first start serving the compiled assets:

```shell
npm run serve
```

This will run a web server on port `8080` pointing at the `build` directory. You'll need to manually rebuild if any of the assets change.

To point your Brightspace instance at the local integration project, there are two options:

Option 1:

In the Config Variable browser of your local instance, set the value of `d2l.System.BsiEndpointOverride` to the `brightspace-integration (BSI)` localhost server (or your computer's hostname) - note the trailing `/`.

Option 2:

1. Go to your `{instance}/config/Infrastructure` directory
2. Edit `D2L.LP.Web.UI.Html.Bsi.config.json`
3. Change the `polymer-3` property to the `brightspace-integration (BSI)` localhost server (or your computer's hostname) - note the trailing `/`
4. Restart IIS

The config file will get overwritten during an LMS build.

### Running locally with a local web component

A common use case for running a local BSI is to test out a web component you're also working on locally. That way you can avoid releasing the component and pulling the new release into BSI until you're ready.

To link your local BSI with a local web component, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that your component has a valid `package.json` with a `name` entry
2. Ensure that BSI is already pulling in your component in its `package.json` as a dependency
3. In the component's directory, run `npm link`
4. In BSI, run `npm link <component-name>`, where `<component-name>` matches the entry in `package.json`
5. In BSI, run `rm -rf ./node_modules/<component-name>/node_modules`. This ensures that when `polymer build` is run, it does not end up with nested copies of components. **Caveat**: if your component is pulling in a new dependency that isn't already in BSI, this won't work. In this case, you can try deleting everything _except_ that new dependency, or installing that new dependency from BSI directly, without saving that to BSI's `package.json`.

Then follow the instructions in the previous section to serve BSI and point your local intance at it.

## Want a slightly faster build?

When we bundle our web components, we produce an ES6 bundle for browsers who support it, and an ES5 transpiled bundle for IE11. If you don't care about IE11, you can exclude that part of the build by running `npm run build-no-es5` or `npm run serve-no-es5`.

## NPM Dependency Locking

We use a `package-lock.json` file to lock our NPM dependencies. This ensures we only pick up changes to dependencies when we explicitly ask for them and are prepared to test them.

Any command that would normally add or update `package.json` will also update `package-lock.json` -- `npm install`, `npm update` etc. Just be cognizant of the changes you're making.

### `package-lock.json` Refresh

Current versions of npm (6.8-6.10) do not always flatten package-lock.json with an `npm i`.  You may end up with many test errors like:

```
Polymer sub-dependency detected "d2l-organizations" in "d2l-activities". All Polymer dependencies must be at root level of "package-lock.json" to avoid duplicate registrations. Check that the version ranges in "package.json" do not contain anything beyond the major version.
```

If you've ensured that you aren't importing multiple versions, try the following:
1) Windows: `ri ./node_modules -Recurse -Force` or *nix: `rm -rf ./node_modules`
2) `rm package-lock.json`
3) `npm i`

This sequence will fully refresh your package-lock.json.

## Web Components

This project serves as an integration point for our web components and we are using [Polymer CLI's](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/apps/build-for-production) `build` command to manage common dependencies between components and generate web component bundles.

To integrate a new web component into BSI, perform the following steps:

1. Reference your component as an NPM dependency using the path to the repository plus a semver tag (e.g. `"d2l-navigation": "BrightspaceUI/navigation#semver:^3"`). **Do not include minor or patch versions.**
2. Add a JavaScript file (i.e. `d2l-my-component.js`) to the `web-components` directory that imports the new web component. (i.e. `../node_modules/my-component/my-component.js`)
3. Reference the new JavaScript file from the fragments list in `polymer.json`

## Tagging & Publishing

When a pull request is merged to `master`, a version tag corresponding with the current active development release of Brightspace will be automatically applied by CI. A build number will be incremented for each build.

When a pull request is merged to a branch whose name matches our versioning scheme (e.g. `20.19.5`), a version tag for that release will be automatically applied.

For each tag, the project assets (contents of the `build` directory) will be automatically published to the Brightspace CDN by its [Travis CI job](https://travis-ci.org/Brightspace/brightspace-integration).

The publish location will be: `https://s.brightspace.com/lib/bsi/{version}/`

To skip automatic tagging and releasing, include the text `[skip release]` in your merge commit message.

## Updating LP to reference the new version of BSI

A set of [Jenkins jobs](https://prod.build.d2l/job/Dev/job/Core%20LMS/job/Sync%20BSI/) checks for new BSI versions every 10 minutes and automatically updates LP to reference your version. Although it merges the change to LP quickly, it also triggers a CI for easy tracking in case there is a problem with the assets published to the CDN. In case of failures you will receive an email from Jenkins (and a message will be sent to the `#build-triage` Slack channel), so that you can investigate and complete the process manually if needed.

This will ensure that the LP (and new CD builds) are using the latest version of BSI.

Note that this is only done on LMS `master`. For hotfixes or updates to branches you'll need to update LP manually by creating a pull request on the appropriate branch in LP
that updates the `polymer-3` line of [D2L.LP.Web.UI.Html.Bsi.config.json](https://git.dev.d2l/projects/CORE/repos/lms/browse/lp/_config/Infrastructure/D2L.LP.Web.UI.Html.Bsi.config.json)

*If you have other dependent Core Lms changes, please make sure you merge those lms changes before bumping BSI.*
